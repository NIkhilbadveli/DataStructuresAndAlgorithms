1) Big O is a mathematical notation for talking about sets of functions by giving
an upper limit to how fast those functions can grow.

2) Big O is an informal way that computer scientists talk about
how much an algorithm is expected to slow down as the algorithm is given bigger and bigger inputs.

So, in the second case, it's like the smallest upper limit function you could find.
